LISA-RIFT: A modified version of RIFT to work for LISA sources. Currently, it can used for analyzing MBHB signals. If you are using this code, please cite: [Adapting a novel framework for rapid inference of massive black hole binaries for LISA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15542). 

Original RIFT paper: [Rapid and accurate parameter inference for coalescing, precessing compact binaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10457)
