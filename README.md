Repository for the rapid_PE / RIFT code, developed at RIT (forked long ago from work at UWM/CGCA).


If you are using this code for a production analysis, please contact us to make sure you follow the instructions included here!
Also, make sure you cite the relevant rapid_pe/RIFT papers

## Authorlists: Opt-in model
Several aspects of this code are very actively developed.  We encourage  close collaboration with the lead developers (O'Shaughnessy and Lange) to produce the best possible results, particularly given comparatively rapid changes to the interface and pipeline in the past and planned for the future as the user- and developer-base expands.

We expect to make the final developed code widely available and free to use, in a release-based distribution model.  But we're not there yet.  To simplify discussions about authorlist and ettiquete, we have adopted the following simple model, to be revised 4 times per year (1/15, 4/15, 7/15, 10/15):
 * Free to use: Any code commit older than 3 years from the date an analysis <i>commences</i> is free to use.  
 * Opt-in: Any more recent use should offer (opt-in) authorship to the lead developers, as well as to developers who contributed significantly to features used in the version of the code adopted in an analysis.  Loosely speaking, the newer the features you use, the more proactive you should be in contacting relevant developers, to insure all authors are suitably engaged with the final product.
This policy refers only to commits in this repository, and not to resources and code maintained elsewhere or by other developers (e.g., NR Surrogates), who maintain their own policy


The following authors should be contacted 
  * O'Shaughnessy and Lange: Iterative pipeline, fitting and posterior generation code, external interfaces (EOB, surrogates)
