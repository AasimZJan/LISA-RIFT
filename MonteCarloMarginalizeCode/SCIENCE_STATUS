URGENT PRIORITIES

* Holiday break prep 
   - Urgent choices
             - distance cutoff
             - integrator unbuffered 
             - installation requirements doc: statsmodels.
   - Implement match cutoff: e.g, 0.95 or 1-0.1(8/rho)^2.  Use 500 mass points. [Documentation: run dag!]
   - Validate code
              - against no signal (ideally real noise)
              - reproducible results (=error estimate in integral)

* Convergence and adaptation
    - document adaptive samplers on master [makefile targets]
    - implement, document adaptive sampler test suite on master
          - 6d gaussian
    - convergence theory with adaptation
        - must have robust theory (and demonstrations) showing when overconvergence 
          occurs and how to control it


* Bugfixing
   - failure for high-snr MDC. Precision loss?

PROTOTYPING 

* Prototype-scale investigations
    - Array-based time marginalization                                            [Richard]
    - Vectorized parameter passing (phi,pis,d... as arrays)                   [Richard?] 

* Computational cost 
    - Long waveforms not a limit : runtime trend vs flow, seglen        [Richard?]


FEATURE REQUETS
  - Report on P(<x_inj) for each parameter
  - Effective Fisher code reports area (in mc, eta) populated, and fraction lost to cutoffs
    Allows us to use m1,m2 samples to get total evidence via monte carlo integral
    (with m1,m2 prior)


TABLED UNTIL AFTER LARGE-SCAL RUNS

* Priors
 - sky prior     : reimplement ability to run with a skymap 
 - Distancce prior: Cutoff?  can we use *only* distance adaptation?
 - Time prior    : investigate safe inteval. Concrete examples with different injections (and gracedb)
                     : template (model/model, mass/mass) mismatches and timeshifts, re prior
                     : targeting smaller interval for time

 - Adaptive priors testing
       - Explore othe coordinates: phi+/- psi, inclination
       - Adaptation catastrophes ("overconvergence")
       - Adaptation in 2d? (distance-inclination; *skymap*)

* Sampling in mass, spin space
    - quasi-hierarchical: use autocorrelation scale (Fisher matrix) to reduce sampling density when we have very poor constraints.
      Go to denser sampling  when evidence high.

* Data handling
    - Automate dag to select correct # of IFOs (e.g., from coinc) and PSDs

* Understand 
     -  inverse spec truncation: why we need an fmax



RECORD

* Priors 
   - distance prior [2013-12-11]  : uniform distance. Cutoff uniform across masses. 10*BNS distance (300 Mpc)
    - Sampling priors to "limit the worst case" runtime
         - uniform in iota [2013-12-17]
   - time prior changed to +/-50ms [2013-12-19]

* Sampler
      - adaptive sampler on master [2013-12-20]
      - Implement adaptation on master [ra, dec, d]
        Reproducible results for 2-ifo case, with and without adaptation. [2013-12-20]
        Available in zero_noise_mdc makefile targets

  
* Convergence
   - neff [2013-12-11] implementation fixed, mcsampler cleaned
   - Run dag + infrastructure, demonstrate fully-automated operation working (e.g., data selection, ...).


* Data handling:
    - Inverse spectrum truncation:
        - Implemented in lalsimutils IP class [2013-12-13]


* Likelihood
      - time marginalization v0:  [2013-12-16]

* Miscellaneous
   - data output truncation via --save-P, etc [2013-12-18]
   -  confirmed 2ifo works [2013-12-19]

   - GraceDB pipeline demo [2013-12-20]
   - error estimate report in xmlutils.py [2013-12-20]
