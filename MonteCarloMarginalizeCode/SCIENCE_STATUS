URGENT PRIORITIES

* "Ringing": Investigate how to control (inverse power spectrum, windowing, etc), propose patch, quantify error residual, and commit
   - Tukey window 'temporary' solution
   - Implement PSD truncation, revisit next meeting

* Fixes and implementations
   - distance prior  : uniform distance. Cutoff uniform across masses. 10*BNS distance (300 Mpc)
   - time prior : investigate whether best-fit time shifts much vs mass. 
          Preliminary answer: Is our 2ms window too tight? [tool: lalsimutils/overlap]
   - convergence: neff, how implemented, when to stop
      * code cleanup in mcsampler



TABLED UNTIL AFTER CODE WORKING


* Priors
 - Distancce prior: Cutoff
 - Time prior    : investigate safe inteval. Concrete examples with different injections (and gracedb)
                     : template (model/model, mass/mass) mismatches and timeshifts, re prior


* Study injection change with truncation window (e.g., inverse PSD truncation)

* Sampling in mass space
