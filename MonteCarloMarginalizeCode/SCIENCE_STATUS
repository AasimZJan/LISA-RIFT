URGENT PRIORITIES

* Fixes and implementations
   - time prior : -implement 100ms time window for now
                     - investigate time biases in real searches     

* Zero noise simulations
    - ILE + zero_noise_mdc :
           Cost assessment + inputs to prototype others
         - pinned sky location                                                           [Chris]
         - large-neff run, fully unpinned : 2 mass points                        [Chris]
    - ILE + Chris' MDCs [all]
    - Larger-scale MDCs

* Convergence and adaptation
    - implement adaptive priors on master
    - convergence theory with adaptation

PROTOTYPING 

* Prototype-scale investigations
    - Array-based time marginalization                                            [Richard]

* Computational cost 
    - Long waveforms not a limit : runtime trend vs flow, seglen        [Richard?]


TABLED UNTIL AFTER CODE WORKING

* Priors
 - sky prior     : reimplement ability to run with a skymap 
 - Distancce prior: Cutoff
 - Time prior    : investigate safe inteval. Concrete examples with different injections (and gracedb)
                     : template (model/model, mass/mass) mismatches and timeshifts, re prior
                     : targeting smaller interval for time

 - Adaptive priors, fully implemented

* Sampling in mass space

* Understand 
     -  inverse spec truncation: why we need an fmax

RECORD

* Priors 
   - distance prior [2013-12-11]  : uniform distance. Cutoff uniform across masses. 10*BNS distance (300 Mpc)
    - Sampling priors to "limit the worst case" runtime
         - uniform in iota [2013-12-17]
   - time prior changed to +/-50ms [2013-12-19]

* Convergence
   - neff [2013-12-11] implementation fixed, mcsampler cleaned


* Data handling:
    - Inverse spectrum truncation:
        - Implemented in lalsimutils IP class [2013-12-13]

* Likelihood
      - time marginalization v0:  [2013-12-16]


* Miscellaneous
   - data output truncation via --save-P, etc [2013-12-18]
   -  confirmed 2ifo works [2013-12-19]
