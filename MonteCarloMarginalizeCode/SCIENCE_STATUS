URGENT PRIORITIES

* Truncation and related: Make sure code in place on master                 [Evan]
   - document time buffer duration clearly in comments/help
   - adopt and automate data retrieval and handling (e.g., Tukey window or not)

* Fixes and implementations
   - time prior : -investigate whether best-fit time shifts much vs mass.  [Evan]
                     -is our 2ms time window too tight?                           [Evan : template mismatch /Richard: sky]
   - time marginalization: - integrate outward, narrow window              [Evan]

* Zero noise simulations
    - ILE + zero_noise_mdc :
           Cost assessment + inputs to prototype others
         - pinned sky location                                                           [Chris]
         - large-neff run, fully unpinned : 2 mass points                        [Chris]

* Convergence and data storage
    - how many points should we keep? [Use zero-noise-mdc data]        [Richard]                   
      scaling of Z, neff, error, PDFs  with neff, N

PROTOTYPING 

* Prototype-scale investigations
    - Sampling priors to "limit the worst case" runtime
         - uniform in iota                                                               [Chris]

    - Adaptive sampling priors                                                      [Chris]         

* Computational cost 
    - Long waveforms not a limit : runtime trend vs flow, seglen        [Richard?]

TABLED UNTIL AFTER CODE WORKING

* Priors
 - sky prior     : reimplement ability to run with a skymap 
 - Distancce prior: Cutoff
 - Time prior    : investigate safe inteval. Concrete examples with different injections (and gracedb)
                     : template (model/model, mass/mass) mismatches and timeshifts, re prior

 - Adaptive priors, fully implemented

* Sampling in mass space

* Understand 
     -  inverse spec truncation: why we need an fmax

RECORD

* Priors 
   - distance prior [2013-12-11]  : uniform distance. Cutoff uniform across masses. 10*BNS distance (300 Mpc)

* Convergence
   - neff [2013-12-11] implementation fixed, mcsampler cleaned


* Data handling:
    - Inverse spectrum truncation:
        - Implemented in lalsimutils IP class [2013-12-13]
