URGENT PRIORITIES

* "Ringing": Investigate how to control (inverse power spectrum, windowing, etc), propose patch, quantify error residual, and commit
   - increase time buffer  duration [>8s]
   - Tukey window 'temporary' solution
   - Implement PSD truncation, revisit next meeting
     *  Status: Evan has code, validate and push

* Fixes and implementations
   - time prior : investigate whether best-fit time shifts much vs mass. 
          Preliminary answer: Is our 2ms window too tight? [tool: lalsimutils/overlap]

* Zero noise simulations
    - ILE + zero_noise_mdc 
         - scaling of Z, neff,  with number of trials
         - pinning:  use increasing number of parameters (e.g., sky loc pinned). 
           How many iteration are needed for the 'easy' answer?
         - make sure redoble : add to zero_noise_mdc/Makefile

* Convergence and data storage
    - how many poins should we keep

TABLED UNTIL AFTER CODE WORKING


* Priors
 - Distancce prior: Cutoff
 - Time prior    : investigate safe inteval. Concrete examples with different injections (and gracedb)
                     : template (model/model, mass/mass) mismatches and timeshifts, re prior


* Study injection change with truncation window (e.g., inverse PSD truncation)

* Sampling in mass space



RECORD

* Priors 
   - distance prior [2013-12-11]  : uniform distance. Cutoff uniform across masses. 10*BNS distance (300 Mpc)

* Convergence
   - neff [2013-12-11] implementation fixed, mcsampler cleaned
