URGENT PRIORITIES

* Holiday break prep 
   - Implement adaptation on master [ra, dec, d]
   - Choose distance cutoff so we don't burn ourselves with MDC testing
   - Implement match cutoff: e.g, 0.95 or 1-0.1(8/rho)^2.  Use 500 mass points. [Documentation: run dag!]
   - Run dag + infrastructure, demonstrate fully-automated operation working (e.g., data selection, ...)

* Convergence and adaptation
    - implement adaptive samplers on master
    - implement adaptive sampler test suite on master
          - 6d gaussian
          - 2ifo  (e.g., with and without adaptation) - say, in zero-noise-mdc
    - convergence theory with adaptation
        - must have robust theory (and demonstrations) showing when overconvergence 
          occurs and how to control it


PROTOTYPING 

* Prototype-scale investigations
    - Array-based time marginalization                                            [Richard]
    - Vectorized parameter passing (phi,pis,d... as arrays)                   [Richard?] 

* Computational cost 
    - Long waveforms not a limit : runtime trend vs flow, seglen        [Richard?]


TABLED UNTIL AFTER CODE WORKING

* Priors
 - sky prior     : reimplement ability to run with a skymap 
 - Distancce prior: Cutoff?  can we use *only* distance adaptation?
 - Time prior    : investigate safe inteval. Concrete examples with different injections (and gracedb)
                     : template (model/model, mass/mass) mismatches and timeshifts, re prior
                     : targeting smaller interval for time

 - Adaptive priors testing
       - Explore othe coordinates: phi+/- psi, inclination
       - Adaptation catastrophes ("overconvergence")
       - Adaptation in 2d? (distance-inclination; *skymap*)

* Sampling in mass space

* Understand 
     -  inverse spec truncation: why we need an fmax

RECORD

* Priors 
   - distance prior [2013-12-11]  : uniform distance. Cutoff uniform across masses. 10*BNS distance (300 Mpc)
    - Sampling priors to "limit the worst case" runtime
         - uniform in iota [2013-12-17]
   - time prior changed to +/-50ms [2013-12-19]

* Convergence
   - neff [2013-12-11] implementation fixed, mcsampler cleaned


* Data handling:
    - Inverse spectrum truncation:
        - Implemented in lalsimutils IP class [2013-12-13]

* Likelihood
      - time marginalization v0:  [2013-12-16]


* Miscellaneous
   - data output truncation via --save-P, etc [2013-12-18]
   -  confirmed 2ifo works [2013-12-19]
