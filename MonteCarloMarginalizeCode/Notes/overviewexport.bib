  abstract =      {We present the details of a method for conducting a
                   targeted, coherent search for compact binary
                   coalescences. The search is tailored to be used as a
                   followup to electromagnetic transients such as Gamma
                   Ray Bursts. We derive the coherent search statistic
                   for Gaussian detector noise and discuss the benefits
                   of a coherent, multi-detector search over coincidence
                   methods. To mitigate the effects of non-stationary
                   data, we introduce a number of signal consistency
                   tests, including the null SNR, amplitude consistency
                   and several $\chi^{2}$ tests. We demonstrate the
                   search performance on Gaussian noise and on data from
                   LIGO's fourth science run and verify that the signal
                   consistency tests are capable of removing the
                   majority of noise transients and the search gives an
                   efficiency comparable to that achieved in Gaussian
                   noise.},

  abstract =      {The most promising source of gravitational waves for
                   the planned kilometer-size laser-interferometer
                   detectors LIGO and VIRGO are merging compact
                   binaries, i.e., neutron-star-neutron-star (NS-NS),
                   neutron-star-black-hole (NS-BH), and
                   black-hole-black-hole (BH-BH) binaries. We
                   investigate how accurately the distance to the source
                   and the masses and spins of the two bodies will be
                   measured from the inspiral gravitational wave signals
                   by the three-detector LIGO-VIRGO network using
                   ``advanced detectors'' (those present a few years
                   after initial operation). The large number of cycles
                   in the observable waveform increases our sensitivity
                   to those parameters that affect the inspiral rate,
                   and thereby the evolution of the waveform's phase.
                   These parameters are thus measured much more
                   accurately than parameters which affect the
                   waveform's polarization or amplitude. To lowest order
                   in a post-Newtonian expansion, the evolution of the
                   waveform's phase depends only on the combination
                   scrM=(M1M2)3/5(M1+M2)-1/5 of the masses M1 and M2 of
                   the two bodies, which is known as the ``chirp mass.''
                   To post-1-Newtonian order, the waveform's phase also
                   depends sensitively on the binary's reduced mass
                   mu=M1M2/(M1+M2) allowing, in principle, a measurement
                   of both M1 and M2 with high accuracy. We show that
                   the principal obstruction to measuring M1 and M2 is
                   the post-1.5-Newtonian effect of the bodies' spins on
                   the waveform's phase, which can mimic the effects
                   that allow mu to be determined. The chirp mass is
                   measurable with an accuracy
                   DeltascrM/scrM~=0.1\%-1\%. Although this is a
                   remarkably small error bar, it is ~10 times larger
                   than previous estimates of DeltascrM/scrM which
                   neglected post-Newtonian effects. The reduced mass is
                   measurable to ~10\%-15\% for NS-NS and NS-BH
                   binaries, and ~50\% for BH-BH binaries (assuming
                   10Msolar BH's). Measurements of the masses and spins
                   are strongly correlated; there is a combination of mu
                   and the spin angular momenta that is measured to
                   within ~1\%. Moreover, if both spins were somehow
                   known to be small (<~0.01M21 and <~0.01M22,
                   respectively), then mu could be determined to within
                   ~1\%. Finally, building on earlier work of Markovic,
                   we derive an approximate, analytic expression for the
                   accuracy DeltaD of mesurements of the distance D to
                   the binary, for an arbitrary network of detectors.
                   This expression is accurate to linear order in 1/rho,
                   where rho is the signal-to-noise ratio. We also show
                   that, contrary to previous expectations,
                   contributions to DeltaD/D that are nonlinear in 1/rho
                   are significant, and we develop an approximation
                   scheme for including the dominant of these nonlinear
                   effects. Using a Monte Carlo simulation we estimate
                   that distance measurement accuracies will be <=15\%
                   for ~8\% of the detected signals, and <=30\% for
                   ~60\% of the signals, for the LIGO-VIRGO
                   three-detector network.},

  abstract =      {The detection of the gravitational waves (GWs)
                   emitted by precessing binaries of spinning compact
                   objects is complicated by the large number of
                   parameters (such as the magnitudes and initial
                   directions of the spins, and the position and
                   orientation of the binary with respect to the
                   detector) that are required to model accurately the
                   precession-induced modulations of the GW signal. In
                   this paper we describe a fast matched-filtering
                   search scheme for precessing binaries, and we adopt
                   the physical template family proposed by Buonanno,
                   Chen, and Vallisneri [Phys.Rev.D 67, 104025 (2003)]
                   for ground-based interferometers. This family
                   provides essentially exact waveforms, written
                   directly in terms of the physical parameters, for
                   binaries with a single significant spin, and for
                   which the observed GW signal is emitted during the
                   phase of adiabatic inspiral (for LIGO-I and VIRGO,
                   this corresponds to a total mass M &lt; 15Msun). We
                   show how the detection statistic can be maximized
                   automatically over all the parameters (including the
                   position and orientation of the binary with respect
                   to the detector), except four (the two masses, the
                   magnitude of the single spin, and the opening angle
                   between the spin and the orbital angular momentum),
                   so the template bank used in the search is only
                   four-dimensional; this technique is relevant also to
                   the searches for GW from extreme--mass-ratio
                   inspirals and supermassive blackhole inspirals to be
                   performed using the space-borne detector LISA. Using
                   the LIGO-I design sensitivity, we compute the
                   detection threshold (~10) required for a false-alarm
                   probability of 10^(-3)/year, and the number of
                   templates (~76,000) required for a minimum match of

                   considered three categories of compact binary

                   the detectors could probe to distances as far as tens
                   of Mpc, no gravitational-wave signals were identified

                   solar masses; LISA can do high SNR (of order 104),
                   high accuracy studies in the mass range of about
                   105-108 solar masses. BBHs might well be the first
                   sources detected by LIGO-VIRGO: they are visible to
                   much larger distances-up to 500 Mpc by initial
                   interferometers-than coalescing neutron star binaries
                   (heretofore regarded as the ``bread and butter''
                   workhorse source for LIGO-VIRGO, visible to about 30
                   Mpc by initial interferometers). Low-mass BBHs (up to
                   50Msolar for initial LIGO interferometers, 100Msolar
                   for advanced, 106Msolar for LISA) are best searched
                   for via their well-understood inspiral waves; higher
                   mass BBHs must be searched for via their poorly
                   understood merger waves and/or their well-understood
                   ringdown waves. A matched filtering search for
                   massive BBHs based on ringdown waves should be
                   capable of finding BBHs in the mass range of about
                   100Msolar-700Msolar out to ~200 Mpc for initial LIGO
                   interferometers, and in the mass range of ~200Msolar
                   to ~3000Msolar out to about z=1 for advanced
                   interferometers. The required number of templates is
                   of the order of 6000 or less. Searches based on
                   merger waves could increase the number of detected
                   massive BBHs by a factor of the order of 10 over
                   those found from inspiral and ringdown waves, without
                   detailed knowledge of the waveform shapes, using a
                   noise monitoring search algorithm which we describe.
                   A full set of merger templates from numerical
                   relativity simulations could further increase the
                   number of detected BBHs by an additional factor of up
                   to ~4.},

                   analysis of the gravitational-wave signals from
                   spinning neutron stars for Earth-based laser
                   interferometric detectors. We introduce a detailed
                   model of the signal including both the frequency and
                   the amplitude modulations. We include the effects of
                   the intrinsic frequency changes and the modulation of
                   the frequency at the detector due to Earth's motion.
                   We estimate the effects of the star's proper motion
                   and of relativistic corrections. Moreover we consider
                   a signal consisting of two components corresponding
                   to a frequency f and twice that frequency. From the
                   maximum likelihood principle we derive the detection
                   statistics for the signal and we calculate the
                   probability density function of the statistics. We
                   obtain the data analysis procedure to detect the
                   signal and to estimate its parameters. We show that
                   for optimal detection of the amplitude modulated
                   signal we need four linear filters instead of one
                   linear filter needed for a constant amplitude signal.
                   Searching for the doubled frequency signal increases
                   further the number of linear filters by a factor of
                   2. We indicate how the fast Fourier transform
                   algorithm and resampling methods commonly proposed in
                   the analysis of periodic signals can be used to
                   calculate the detection statistics for our signal. We
                   find that the probability density function of the
                   detection statistics is determined by one parameter:
                   the optimal signal-to-noise ratio. We study the
                   signal-to-noise ratio by means of the Monte Carlo
                   method for all long-arm interferometers that are
                   currently under construction. We show how our
                   analysis can be extended to perform a joint search
                   for periodic signals by a network of detectors and we
                   perform a Monte Carlo study of the signal-to-noise
                   ratio for a network of detectors.},

                   waveforms for spinning compact binaries with
                   precession effects through 1.5PN order in amplitude
                   and compute their mode decomposition using
                   spin-weighted -2 spherical harmonics. In the presence
                   of precession, the gravitational-wave modes (l,m)
                   contain harmonics originating from combinations of
                   the orbital frequency and precession frequencies. We
                   find that the gravitational radiation from binary
                   systems with large mass asymmetry and large
                   inclination angle can be distributed among several
                   modes. For example, during the last stages of
                   inspiral, for some maximally spinning configurations,
                   the amplitude of the (2,0) and (2,1) modes can be
                   comparable to the amplitude of the (2,2) mode. If the
                   mass ratio is not too extreme, the l=3 and l=4 modes
                   are generally one or two orders of magnitude smaller
                   than the l = 2 modes. Restricting ourselves to
                   spinning, non-precessing compact binaries, we apply
                   the stationary-phase approximation and derive the
                   frequency-domain gravitational waveforms including
                   spin-orbit and spin(1)- spin(2) effects through 1.5PN
                   and 2PN order respectively in amplitude, and 2.5PN
                   order in phase. Since spin effects in the amplitude
                   through 2PN order affect only the first and second
                   harmonics of the orbital phase, they do not extend
                   the mass reach of gravitational-wave detectors.
                   However, they can interfere with other harmonics and
                   lower or raise the signal-to-noise ratio depending on
                   the spin orientation. These ready-to-use waveforms
                   could be employed in the data-analysis of the
                   spinning, inspiraling binaries as well as in
                   comparison studies at the interface between
                   analytical and numerical relativity.},

                   solved perturbatively using the post-Newtonian (PN)
                   approximation. The evolution of the orbital phase and
                   the emitted gravitational radiation are now known to
                   a rather high order up to O(v^8), v being the
                   characteristic velocity of the binary. The orbital
                   evolution, however, cannot be specified uniquely due
                   to the inherent freedom in the choice of parameter
                   used in the PN expansion as well as the method
                   pursued in solving the relevant differential
                   equations. The goal of this paper is to determine the
                   (dis)agreement between different PN waveform families
                   in the context of initial and advanced
                   gravitational-wave detectors. The waveforms employed
                   in our analysis are those that are currently used by
                   Initial LIGO/Virgo, that is the time-domain PN models
                   TaylorT1, TaylorT2, TaylorT3, TaylorT4 and TaylorEt,
                   the effective one-body (EOB) model, and the
                   Fourier-domain representation TaylorF2. We examine
                   the overlaps of these models with one another and
                   with the prototype effective one-body model
                   (calibrated to numerical relativity simulations, as
                   currently used by initial LIGO) for a number of
                   different binaries at 2PN, 3PN and 3.5PN orders to
                   quantify their differences and to help us decide
                   whether there exist preferred families that are the
                   most appropriate as search templates. We conclude
                   that as long as the total mass remains less than a
                   certain upper limit M_crit, all template families at
                   3.5PN order (except TaylorT3 and TaylorEt) are
                   equally good for the purpose of detection. The value
                   of M_crit is found to be ~ 12M_Sun for Initial,
                   Enhanced and Advanced LIGO. From a purely
                   computational point of view we recommend that 3.5PN
                   TaylorF2 be used below Mcrit and EOB calibrated to
                   numerical relativity simulations be used for total
                   binary mass M > Mcrit.},
