Rationale:
        To test our code using templates identical to the injected waveform,
        but *also* in a way comparable to the 'full physics' tests provided by the MDC

Method:
        Rerun ILE with the injected spins =0 *manually* in the injection XML.

        Coincs are generated via the injection XML, via bayestar_littlehope
