Files/Scripts that you will need to do *all* of the targets (those not included in our standard suite)

1. ligolw_inj_snr (part of excesspower-utils): Used to calculate the network SNR of a simulation entry.
    - Should really use lalsimutils based library code
    - In the meantime, can clone: https://github.com/cpankow/excesspower-utils.git
        - check bin/ligolw_inj_snr
2. H1L1-ALL_LLOID_1_injections-966384015-5184000.sqlite
    - To get coinc information (masses, snr)
    - At CIT: /home/alexander.urban/Raven/2015/bayestar_injection_run/H1L1-ALL_LLOID_1_injections-966384015-5184000.sqlite

Instructions:

1. Go into stage_injections. One can give an individual sim_id to stage from the injections XML (2015_BNS_injections.xml) or if no additional arguments are given, it will check the condition (currently all injections between 10 < d < 50 Mpc) and do each.
2. This will create a sim_id_X directory with a Makefile and a mdc.xml.gz. Going into this directory and running:

    make marginalize_extrinsic_parameters.dag

will create all requisite data and DAG products.

    - If one wishes to stage *all* the directories, the top level Makefile has the all_dirs target. Use this.

3. Running an individual DAG is no different than normal. To make a composite DAG from all staged events with the ``build_dag'' script, as so:

    ./build_dag "sim_id_*_common/"

Where the quotes are necessary to pass the glob directly to the script.

3. After the DAG is completed, in the subdirectory, one can clean up and get some postrun statistics with:

    make postprocess

    - This currently requires ligolw_inj_snr (explained above)
